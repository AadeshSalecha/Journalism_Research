After a month of living in on-base housing at MacDill Air Force Base, Norquist noticed her children were getting sick, especially her youngest children Ethan and her three-year-old daughter Elise. They both developed respiratory problems and inflammation. Soon after Amie, her husband and her two oldest children Allie and Jason started experiencing similar symptoms. Soon mold was discovered. The family claims the private company running the housing did little to solve the problem. The Norquist family was forced to move off base. Like the Norquists, ten additional families have come forward having experienced the same problem with the base. Norquist said there are still many families that are afraid to come forward. “When you’re messing with my kids,” Norquist said. “I’m not going anywhere.” [Times photo by Bronte Wittpenn]",[Times photo by Bronte Wittpenn
