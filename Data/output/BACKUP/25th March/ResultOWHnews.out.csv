But on a serious note, Kacey Musgraves' beautiful and striking album will win here. Part of my reasoning comes from there being four rap-based albums in the mix, along with two R&B ones, and they'll all share too many votes to win. The race is between Brandi Carlile, whose album is also excellent, and Musgraves, who had more buzz this year, won honors at country awards shows and reached audiences outside of the country world with her pop-leaning album. ""Golden Hour"" will win in the final Grammy hour.Kacey Musgraves performs ""Slow Burn"" at the 52nd annual CMA Awards at Bridgestone Arena on Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn.

Michael Jackson (XXVII, 1993)Every halftime show before this one seems forgettable by comparison. After taking the stage in his '90s standard military-style costume, the cheers were so loud that Michael stood still for a full 90 seconds before stripping to his black and white ""Billie Jean"" outfit and tearing up the stage with his effortlessly smooth dance moves. A rocking take on ""Black and White"" followed, and the 12-minute set closed with ""Heal the World,"" which was awesome even if it's not your favorite song. MJ set the bar high — high enough that his halftime showed the performance could be more memorable than the game itself.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
357,owhnews,,,6,"4. Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Kid Rock, P. Diddy, Nelly (XXXVIII, 2004)Though it gave birth to the term ""wardrobe malfunction,"" the performance itself was far better than anyone remembers. In an era when MTV produced the halftime show, it truly became a spectacle full of musician cameos and insane medleys. That night, before ""Nipplegate"" erupted, Jessica Simpson got things started before a marching band played some OutKast, Janet sang ""All For You"" before P. Diddy and Nelly slipped onstage to battle it out. Then Kid Rock did what he did best — blow off fireworks and rap while wearing an American flag. Whereas, Aerosmith a few years earlier had performed a so-bad-it-was-good version of ""Walk This Way"" (with a crazy list of cameos from N'Sync, Britney Spears, Nelly and Mary J. Blige), this show was a fluid performance that finished with Janet blasting back onstage for ""Rhythm Nation"" before Timberlake joined to do ""Rock Your Body."" And, perhaps even more memorably, tear off part of Janet's shirt.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
357,owhnews,,,6,"3. Beyonce (XLVII, 2013)Beyonce's 15-minute medley was the fiercest show ever at the 50-yard line. Flanked by a load of dancers, she popped up and proceeded through ""Crazy In Love,"" ""Baby Boy,"" ""Halo"" and other songs with precision usually only reserved for a heavily edited music video. Beyonce blew onto the stage and didn't stop until she hit every last high note and struck every last pose. And as an added treat, she reunited with her Destiny's Child compatriots Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams for ""Bootylicious,"" ""Independent Women"" and ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)."" It was, from start to finish, flawless.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
357,owhnews,,,6,"2. Bruce Springsteen (XKLIII, 2009)Some people like the pop star performances full of blasting fireworks, cadres of lock-stepping dancers and duets from unlikely partners, but the Boss showed you don't have to be a twentysomething with exposed abs and a bunch of bubblegum radio hits to crush halftime. That year, Springsteen asked people to step away from the guacamole and put those chicken fingers down and rock out for a few minutes, and he and the E Street Band led the way with ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" ""Born to Run,"" ""Working on a Dream"" and ""Glory Days,"" downloading the usual electricity from one of his hours-long marathon concerts into just 12 minutes.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
357,owhnews,,,6,"1. Prince (XLI, 2007)The morning of Feb. 2, 2007, it poured rain in Miami. A producer wondered about calling off the halftime show, so he called Prince. The Purple One's response: ""Can you make it rain harder?"" Prince roared into ""Let's Go Crazy"" and covers of ""All Along the Watchtower,"" ""The Best of You,"" ""We Will Rock You"" and ""Proud Mary"" all while tearing through guitar solos like only Prince could. His choice to play other people's songs made it a more of a rock 'n' roll moment. And the rain only made the set's finale of ""Purple Rain"" — with the stadium lit up in purple and Prince shredding away on his signature guitar — even more fitting. It was like he called for the sky to open up himself.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Michael Jackson (XXVII, 1993)Every halftime show before this one seems forgettable by comparison. After taking the stage in his '90s standard military-style costume, the cheers were so loud that Michael stood still for a full 90 seconds before stripping to his black and white ""Billie Jean"" outfit and tearing up the stage with his effortlessly smooth dance moves. A rocking take on ""Black and White"" followed, and the 12-minute set closed with ""Heal the World,"" which was awesome even if it's not your favorite song. MJ set the bar high — high enough that his halftime showed the performance could be more memorable than the game itself.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
515,owhnews,,,6,"4. Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Kid Rock, P. Diddy, Nelly (XXXVIII, 2004)Though it gave birth to the term ""wardrobe malfunction,"" the performance itself was far better than anyone remembers. In an era when MTV produced the halftime show, it truly became a spectacle full of musician cameos and insane medleys. That night, before ""Nipplegate"" erupted, Jessica Simpson got things started before a marching band played some OutKast, Janet sang ""All For You"" before P. Diddy and Nelly slipped onstage to battle it out. Then Kid Rock did what he did best — blow off fireworks and rap while wearing an American flag. Whereas, Aerosmith a few years earlier had performed a so-bad-it-was-good version of ""Walk This Way"" (with a crazy list of cameos from N'Sync, Britney Spears, Nelly and Mary J. Blige), this show was a fluid performance that finished with Janet blasting back onstage for ""Rhythm Nation"" before Timberlake joined to do ""Rock Your Body."" And, perhaps even more memorably, tear off part of Janet's shirt.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
515,owhnews,,,6,"3. Beyonce (XLVII, 2013)Beyonce's 15-minute medley was the fiercest show ever at the 50-yard line. Flanked by a load of dancers, she popped up and proceeded through ""Crazy In Love,"" ""Baby Boy,"" ""Halo"" and other songs with precision usually only reserved for a heavily edited music video. Beyonce blew onto the stage and didn't stop until she hit every last high note and struck every last pose. And as an added treat, she reunited with her Destiny's Child compatriots Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams for ""Bootylicious,"" ""Independent Women"" and ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)."" It was, from start to finish, flawless.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
515,owhnews,,,6,"2. Bruce Springsteen (XKLIII, 2009)Some people like the pop star performances full of blasting fireworks, cadres of lock-stepping dancers and duets from unlikely partners, but the Boss showed you don't have to be a twentysomething with exposed abs and a bunch of bubblegum radio hits to crush halftime. That year, Springsteen asked people to step away from the guacamole and put those chicken fingers down and rock out for a few minutes, and he and the E Street Band led the way with ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" ""Born to Run,"" ""Working on a Dream"" and ""Glory Days,"" downloading the usual electricity from one of his hours-long marathon concerts into just 12 minutes.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
515,owhnews,,,6,"1. Prince (XLI, 2007)The morning of Feb. 2, 2007, it poured rain in Miami. A producer wondered about calling off the halftime show, so he called Prince. The Purple One's response: ""Can you make it rain harder?"" Prince roared into ""Let's Go Crazy"" and covers of ""All Along the Watchtower,"" ""The Best of You,"" ""We Will Rock You"" and ""Proud Mary"" all while tearing through guitar solos like only Prince could. His choice to play other people's songs made it a more of a rock 'n' roll moment. And the rain only made the set's finale of ""Purple Rain"" — with the stadium lit up in purple and Prince shredding away on his signature guitar — even more fitting. It was like he called for the sky to open up himself.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Part of my reasoning comes from there being four rap-based albums in the mix, along with two R&B ones, and they'll all share too many votes to win. The race is between Brandi Carlile, whose album is also excellent, and Musgraves, who had more buzz this year, won honors at country awards shows and reached audiences outside of the country world with her pop-leaning album.

Michael Jackson (XXVII, 1993)Every halftime show before this one seems forgettable by comparison. After taking the stage in his '90s standard military-style costume, the cheers were so loud that Michael stood still for a full 90 seconds before stripping to his black and white ""Billie Jean"" outfit and tearing up the stage with his effortlessly smooth dance moves. A rocking take on ""Black and White"" followed, and the 12-minute set closed with ""Heal the World,"" which was awesome even if it's not your favorite song. MJ set the bar high — high enough that his halftime showed the performance could be more memorable than the game itself.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
1031,owhnews,,,6,"4. Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Kid Rock, P. Diddy, Nelly (XXXVIII, 2004)Though it gave birth to the term ""wardrobe malfunction,"" the performance itself was far better than anyone remembers. In an era when MTV produced the halftime show, it truly became a spectacle full of musician cameos and insane medleys. That night, before ""Nipplegate"" erupted, Jessica Simpson got things started before a marching band played some OutKast, Janet sang ""All For You"" before P. Diddy and Nelly slipped onstage to battle it out. Then Kid Rock did what he did best — blow off fireworks and rap while wearing an American flag. Whereas, Aerosmith a few years earlier had performed a so-bad-it-was-good version of ""Walk This Way"" (with a crazy list of cameos from N'Sync, Britney Spears, Nelly and Mary J. Blige), this show was a fluid performance that finished with Janet blasting back onstage for ""Rhythm Nation"" before Timberlake joined to do ""Rock Your Body."" And, perhaps even more memorably, tear off part of Janet's shirt.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
1031,owhnews,,,6,"3. Beyonce (XLVII, 2013)Beyonce's 15-minute medley was the fiercest show ever at the 50-yard line. Flanked by a load of dancers, she popped up and proceeded through ""Crazy In Love,"" ""Baby Boy,"" ""Halo"" and other songs with precision usually only reserved for a heavily edited music video. Beyonce blew onto the stage and didn't stop until she hit every last high note and struck every last pose. And as an added treat, she reunited with her Destiny's Child compatriots Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams for ""Bootylicious,"" ""Independent Women"" and ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)."" It was, from start to finish, flawless.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
1031,owhnews,,,6,"2. Bruce Springsteen (XKLIII, 2009)Some people like the pop star performances full of blasting fireworks, cadres of lock-stepping dancers and duets from unlikely partners, but the Boss showed you don't have to be a twentysomething with exposed abs and a bunch of bubblegum radio hits to crush halftime. That year, Springsteen asked people to step away from the guacamole and put those chicken fingers down and rock out for a few minutes, and he and the E Street Band led the way with ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" ""Born to Run,"" ""Working on a Dream"" and ""Glory Days,"" downloading the usual electricity from one of his hours-long marathon concerts into just 12 minutes.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
1031,owhnews,,,6,"1. Prince (XLI, 2007)The morning of Feb. 2, 2007, it poured rain in Miami. A producer wondered about calling off the halftime show, so he called Prince. The Purple One's response: ""Can you make it rain harder?"" Prince roared into ""Let's Go Crazy"" and covers of ""All Along the Watchtower,"" ""The Best of You,"" ""We Will Rock You"" and ""Proud Mary"" all while tearing through guitar solos like only Prince could. His choice to play other people's songs made it a more of a rock 'n' roll moment. And the rain only made the set's finale of ""Purple Rain"" — with the stadium lit up in purple and Prince shredding away on his signature guitar — even more fitting. It was like he called for the sky to open up himself.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Michael Jackson (XXVII, 1993)Every halftime show before this one seems forgettable by comparison. After taking the stage in his '90s standard military-style costume, the cheers were so loud that Michael stood still for a full 90 seconds before stripping to his black and white ""Billie Jean"" outfit and tearing up the stage with his effortlessly smooth dance moves. A rocking take on ""Black and White"" followed, and the 12-minute set closed with ""Heal the World,"" which was awesome even if it's not your favorite song. MJ set the bar high — high enough that his halftime showed the performance could be more memorable than the game itself.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
1189,owhnews,,,6,"4. Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Kid Rock, P. Diddy, Nelly (XXXVIII, 2004)Though it gave birth to the term ""wardrobe malfunction,"" the performance itself was far better than anyone remembers. In an era when MTV produced the halftime show, it truly became a spectacle full of musician cameos and insane medleys. That night, before ""Nipplegate"" erupted, Jessica Simpson got things started before a marching band played some OutKast, Janet sang ""All For You"" before P. Diddy and Nelly slipped onstage to battle it out. Then Kid Rock did what he did best — blow off fireworks and rap while wearing an American flag. Whereas, Aerosmith a few years earlier had performed a so-bad-it-was-good version of ""Walk This Way"" (with a crazy list of cameos from N'Sync, Britney Spears, Nelly and Mary J. Blige), this show was a fluid performance that finished with Janet blasting back onstage for ""Rhythm Nation"" before Timberlake joined to do ""Rock Your Body."" And, perhaps even more memorably, tear off part of Janet's shirt.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
1189,owhnews,,,6,"3. Beyonce (XLVII, 2013)Beyonce's 15-minute medley was the fiercest show ever at the 50-yard line. Flanked by a load of dancers, she popped up and proceeded through ""Crazy In Love,"" ""Baby Boy,"" ""Halo"" and other songs with precision usually only reserved for a heavily edited music video. Beyonce blew onto the stage and didn't stop until she hit every last high note and struck every last pose. And as an added treat, she reunited with her Destiny's Child compatriots Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams for ""Bootylicious,"" ""Independent Women"" and ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)."" It was, from start to finish, flawless.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
1189,owhnews,,,6,"2. Bruce Springsteen (XKLIII, 2009)Some people like the pop star performances full of blasting fireworks, cadres of lock-stepping dancers and duets from unlikely partners, but the Boss showed you don't have to be a twentysomething with exposed abs and a bunch of bubblegum radio hits to crush halftime. That year, Springsteen asked people to step away from the guacamole and put those chicken fingers down and rock out for a few minutes, and he and the E Street Band led the way with ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" ""Born to Run,"" ""Working on a Dream"" and ""Glory Days,"" downloading the usual electricity from one of his hours-long marathon concerts into just 12 minutes.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
1189,owhnews,,,6,"1. Prince (XLI, 2007)The morning of Feb. 2, 2007, it poured rain in Miami. A producer wondered about calling off the halftime show, so he called Prince. The Purple One's response: ""Can you make it rain harder?"" Prince roared into ""Let's Go Crazy"" and covers of ""All Along the Watchtower,"" ""The Best of You,"" ""We Will Rock You"" and ""Proud Mary"" all while tearing through guitar solos like only Prince could. His choice to play other people's songs made it a more of a rock 'n' roll moment. And the rain only made the set's finale of ""Purple Rain"" — with the stadium lit up in purple and Prince shredding away on his signature guitar — even more fitting. It was like he called for the sky to open up himself.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
