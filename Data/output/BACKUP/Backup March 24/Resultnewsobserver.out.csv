Within a week of Paul McCartney playing a surprise show at Grand Central Station, Starr followed a more old-fashioned path Thursday night, Sept. 13, 2018. The 78-year-old drummer and singer headlined a two-hour show at Radio City Music Hall, in New York, with thousands spending much of the performance standing and singing along.
