For the purposes of this list, we’re defining supermarkets as brick-and-mortar grocers, grocery stores, membership-only warehouse clubs, and nationwide department store retailers that have supermarkets within their retail locations. Convenience stores, delis, farmers markets, local markets, and virtual shops like FoodKick and Peapod were not considered. In addition, we only considered supermarkets that have outposts in multiple states and that have more than five locations total. Each supermarket was judged according to the following criteria: stock, services/departments, innovation, customer service, appearance and cleanliness and contribution to the community.
