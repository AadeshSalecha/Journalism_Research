Terrorists have targeted Afghan and U.S. government convoys and facilities as well as nongovernmental organization offices, hospitals, places of worship, restaurants, hotels, airports and schools. The U.S. government’s ability to provide services to Americans in Afghanistan is constrained because of the lack of infrastructure, geographic limitations, and a volatile security situation.

While the general advisory to Burkina Faso is Level 3 – reconsider travel, the State Department advises against traveling to one region in the country — the northern Sahel border with Mali and Niger. In that region, organized criminal groups and terrorists particularly target Westerners, plotting kidnappings. In the entire country — a landlocked nation in western Africa — terrorist targets could include hotels, restaurants, police stations and schools.

Burundi police resources are inadequate to address criminal acts, according to the U.S. government. There also is lingering political tension in the African nation, whose GDP per capita of $280 is among the lowest in the world. Frequent police and military checkpoints limit the ability to move freely. The U.S. government says the provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza are susceptible to raids from armed groups from the eastern section of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.S. government said it has scarce resources to provide to Americans in Burundi. The State Department added that medical services in Burundi are not up to American standards.

The State Department advises Americans not to travel to the CAR because of crime and civil instability. The U.S. government has raised concerns over incidences of armed robbery, aggravated battery, and homicide. Many swaths of the Central African Republic are controlled by armed groups who kidnap, injure and kill civilians, according to the U.S. government. Because of unrest in the Central African Republic, airports, land borders and roads may close with little advance notice. U.S. government personnel must get permission to travel outside the embassy grounds and therefore may be limited in how much help they can provide U.S. citizens.

The U.S. government says terrorists can cross Chad’s borders with little difficulty, including in the Lake Chad region. Of particular concern are unmapped minefields along the borders with Libya and Sudan. U.S. government employees need to get special permission to travel to certain parts of the capital N’Djamena, as well as areas such as to the Lake Chad Basin.

Americans are urged not to travel to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the three Kasai provinces because of violence. Armed robbery, home invasion and assault are among the crimes that often occur in the DRC. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, assailants have been known to impersonate police or security agents. Police in the DRC lack the resources to combat violent crime. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also grappling with a worsening Ebola outbreak. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to Americans outside of the capital Kinshasa because of inadequate infrastructure and security.

The capital city of San Salvador has been in the top 20 most dangerous cities in the world since 2014, reaching No. 3 two years ago. Extortion and narcotics and arms trafficking are widespread and the police do not have the resources to fight crime. The U.S. government advises those who travel to El Salvador to avoid walking or driving at night, not to resist a robbery attempt, and to be observant when visiting banks or ATMs.

In Guinea-Bissau, criminals target foreigners at the country’s airport and at the market in the center of the capital of Bissau. The State Department says local police resources are inadequate to respond effectively to criminal incidents. Guinea-Bissau, once a Portuguese colony and a transshipment point for the slave trade, has been plagued by political instability for decades. There is no U.S. embassy in the nation, which is located on Africa’s Atlantic coast.

The nation that was devastated by an earthquake in 2010 now reels from violent crime such as armed robbery. Travelers are sometimes targeted and robbed after they arrive at the airport in Port-au-Prince. The U.S. embassy requires its employees to use official transportation to and from the airport. They are discouraged from going to establishments after dark that do not have secure parking, visiting banks and using ATMs, driving outside of Port-au-Prince at night, or using public transportation or taxis.

Terrorists have targeted Afghan and U.S. government convoys and facilities as well as nongovernmental organization offices, hospitals, places of worship, restaurants, hotels, airports and schools. The U.S. government’s ability to provide services to Americans in Afghanistan is constrained because of the lack of infrastructure, geographic limitations, and a volatile security situation.

In that region, organized criminal groups and terrorists particularly target Westerners, plotting kidnappings. In the entire country — a landlocked nation in western Africa — terrorist targets could include hotels, restaurants, police stations and schools.

There also is lingering political tension in the African nation, whose GDP per capita of $280 is among the lowest in the world. Frequent police and military checkpoints limit the ability to move freely.

The U.S. government says terrorists can cross Chad’s borders with little difficulty, including in the Lake Chad region. Of particular concern are unmapped minefields along the borders with Libya and Sudan. U.S. government employees need to get special permission to travel to certain parts of the capital N’Djamena, as well as areas such as to the Lake Chad Basin.

Americans are urged not to travel to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the three Kasai provinces because of violence. Armed robbery, home invasion and assault are among the crimes that often occur in the DRC. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, assailants have been known to impersonate police or security agents. Police in the DRC lack the resources to combat violent crime. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also grappling with a worsening Ebola outbreak. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to Americans outside of the capital Kinshasa because of inadequate infrastructure and security.

The capital city of San Salvador has been in the top 20 most dangerous cities in the world since 2014, reaching No. 3 two years ago. Extortion and narcotics and arms trafficking are widespread and the police do not have the resources to fight crime. The U.S. government advises those who travel to El Salvador to avoid walking or driving at night, not to resist a robbery attempt, and to be observant when visiting banks or ATMs.

In Guinea-Bissau, criminals target foreigners at the country’s airport and at the market in the center of the capital of Bissau. The State Department says local police resources are inadequate to respond effectively to criminal incidents. Guinea-Bissau, once a Portuguese colony and a transshipment point for the slave trade, has been plagued by political instability for decades. There is no U.S. embassy in the nation, which is located on Africa’s Atlantic coast.

The nation that was devastated by an earthquake in 2010 now reels from violent crime such as armed robbery. Travelers are sometimes targeted and robbed after they arrive at the airport in Port-au-Prince. The U.S. embassy requires its employees to use official transportation to and from the airport. They are discouraged from going to establishments after dark that do not have secure parking, visiting banks and using ATMs, driving outside of Port-au-Prince at night, or using public transportation or taxis.

               – The island where ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was filmed in 2015 has been growing in popularity ever since. Popular appeal, combined with an increase in boat permits, led to almost 17,000 visitors in 2017 and about 7,000 mid-May and mid-July 2018. The UNESCO World Heritage Site allows no more than 180 tourists per day.

               – The 1,600 year-old Mogao Grottoes are known for their Buddhist art and were China's first UNESCO site. The Library Cave uncovered there has been called ""the world's greatest discovery of ancient Oriental culture."" The maximum number of daily visitors is 6,000. During peak season, the daily limit is 10,000 every other day.

               – The ""City of Water"" has adapted aggressive strategies to limit the number of tourists. The annual total has reached 30 million, whereas only about 50,000 people actually live in the city. Tourists visiting for the day (averaging as many as 70,000) may soon be charged an entrance fee of about $11.50. During peak times, tourists and locals can be separated, with visitors being redirected to popular places while some areas are only open to locals.

               – Similar to Venice, one of Spain's most visited cities has been struggling with too many tourists for decades. The city of 1.7 million sees about 32 million tourists a year. No official limit on tourists has been imposed yet, but talk about such restrictions seems to never end. A 2017 law limited the number of beds available in hotels and rentals, imposed a moratorium on building new hotels, and stopped the issuing of licenses for new tourist apartments.

               – Locals are not the only ones who say the city is flooded with tourists; visitors themselves agree their high number of about 20 million a year is a problem. A plan to ban Airbnbs in busy neighborhoods and to limit rentals to 30 days a year outside of them was revealed in May 2018. Passengers visiting on boats will no longer be allowed to disembark in the city center. The plan included a tourist tax hike to 7 percent, up from 6 percent in the city and 4 percent outside it. Other proposals include cruises paying a fee of about $9 per passenger starting this year.

Thousands of people will come together today to remember and honor the millions killed in the Holocaust and mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops on 27th January, 1945. Auschwitz was among the most notorious of the concentration camps run by the Nazis during WWII and whilst it is impossible to put an exact figure on the death toll it is alleged that over a million people lost their lives in the camp, the majority of whom were Jewish.
