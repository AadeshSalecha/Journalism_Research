Longtime associate Alex Cifuentes told authorities a woman would send Guzman photos of young girls to choose from, with a fee of $5,000 per girl.

They played with toys together, with Pony often trying to distract Larry so she could get his toy. But Larry knew her little game and easily gave up his toys to his daughter. Oftentimes, they would just lie next to each other, share kisses and enjoy each other's company. As you know how it always goes, sadly, Pony and I lost Larry in August 2017 when he was 14-1/2. Pony clearly grieved her father's passing, as did I. Thank goodness we have each other. Pony is truly my Valentine every day. (Courtesy of Gail Campbell)",(Courtesy of Gail Campbell)
