240,detroitnews,,,10,"1. Purdue (16-6, 9-2) – For a while on Sunday, it looked like the Boilermakers were going to fall victim to the upset, just as Michigan State and Michigan did this week. Instead, Purdue erased a 13-point second-half deficit at home against Minnesota for its seventh straight victory. The Boilermakers are playing better than anyone in the conference, which moves them to the top for now, and judging by the remaining schedule, it’s hard to see where the next defeat might come. Last week: 3.","Michael Conroy, AP"
240,detroitnews,,,10,"2. Michigan (20-2, 9-2) – The Wolverines have seen their offensive efficiency drop and it played a big part in the loss at Iowa on Friday. However, with a defense that is as good as any in the nation, the Wolverines will be in every game they play. They’ll hit the road this week to play a scrappy Rutgers team before welcoming Wisconsin in what is shaping up to be a critical matchup in the conference race. Last week: 2.","Matthew Holst, Getty Images"
240,detroitnews,,,10,"3. Michigan State (18-4, 9-2) – The Spartans had nearly a week to recover from their loss at Purdue, which ended a 13-game winning streak. However, they were flat at home on Saturday against Indiana, getting outrebounded – including allowing 20 offensive boards – while they shot just 8-for-22 from the free-throw line in an overtime loss. Whether it ultimately amounts to simply a bad game or is a sign of trouble on the horizon remains to be seen. Last week: 1.","Dale G. Young, Detroit News"
240,detroitnews,,,10,"4. Wisconsin (16-6, 8-3) – The Badgers have overcome a slow conference start and are now in the thick of the Big Ten race. Winners of five straight after knocking off Nebraska on the road and Maryland at home, the Badgers are starting to build some momentum headed down the stretch. The upcoming week is a big one with trips to Minnesota and Michigan, two games that could determine whether the Badgers have a shot at the title. Last week: 4.","Andy Manis, AP"
240,detroitnews,,,10,"5. Iowa (17-5, 6-5) – The Hawkeyes continue to be one of the toughest teams in the conference to figure out. They don’t play much defense and entering Friday’s game against Michigan they had lost two straight, giving up 174 points total in the two games. Of course, they followed that by giving up just 59 to upset the Wolverines and now get ready to head to Indiana, which just ended its seven-game skid. Last week: 7.","Charlie Neibergall, AP"
240,detroitnews,,,10,"6. Maryland (17-6, 8-4) – The Terrapins are in the midst of a midseason lull, having lost three of their last four games after having won seven in a row. The lone victory came at home against Northwestern. But the Terps couldn’t build off that, losing at Wisconsin in a game that could prove critical in the Big Ten race. Only one game is up this week, though it will be a challenge for the Terps, who hit the road to take on a Nebraska team that is desperate for a win. Last week: 5.","Andy Manis, AP"
240,detroitnews,,,10,"7. Minnesota (16-6, 6-5) – The Golden Gophers were in perfect position on Sunday, up 13 in the second half at Purdue. However, they couldn’t close the deal and have now lost two of four heading into a week that includes a home game with Wisconsin and a trip to Michigan State. It was an opportunity lost for a team that is scrambling to bolster its NCAA Tournament resume. Last week: 6.","Michael Conroy, AP"
240,detroitnews,,,10,"8. Ohio State (14-7, 4-6) – The Buckeyes missed out on a big opportunity at Michigan early in the week but bounced back to knock off Rutgers for their second win in the last three games. It should signal a turnaround from the five-game skid that had the Buckeyes looking like a team that was playing itself out of the NCAA Tournament. They’ll get Penn State at home this week before heading to Indiana for a critical matchup. Last week: 8.","Paul Vernon, AP"

348,detroitnews,,,10,"A well-dressed table: When it comes to setting a stylish table, ""inspiration can come from lots of different places: Your dishes, the season, table linens, accents, a color palette you want to bring to life,"" Garrity writes. ""Pick your muse, then start to play. If you have more than one set of dishes, mix them up a bit. We like to combine dishes in lots of different colors, styles and patterns.""",Mary Carol Garrity/TNS

348,detroitnews,,,10,"Pay attention to lighting: Lighting is key in any space, Garrity has written.","Mary Carol Garrity, Mary Carol Garrity, TNS"
348,detroitnews,,,10,"Sizing up the right sofa: ""Interior designers like to argue about whether it's more important for a sofa to fit the scale of your room or the contours of your body. In my opinion, you need one that does both, because in the long run, you won't be happy with a sofa that isn't the perfect proportion for your room or for your posterior,"" writes Garrity.","Mary Carol Garrity, TNS"
348,detroitnews,,,10,"Plates as art: Garrity has long confessed her love of plates. ""Whether you have a full set of beautiful patterned dishes you never use or a number of unique singles, hang them on the wall to transform your artwork displays. The round shape and curved edges of dishes do wonders for breaking up a sea of square or rectangular artwork, adding texture and dimension,"" writes Garrity.","Mary Carol Garrity, TNS"
348,detroitnews,,,10,"Brightening up the bedroom: Garrity says one of the easiest and most effective ways to warm a bedroom is with textiles. ""If your bedding ensemble is lackluster or showing some wear, invest in luxurious new linens,"" she writes. ""But when you're picking out your duvet and accent pillows, think twice before you buy a dust ruffle. Many of today's bed styles don't require a dust ruffle, so folks are instead concealing their unattractive box springs with a custom-made cover.""","Mary Carol Garrity, TNS"
348,detroitnews,,,10,"Picking the right lamp: It's all about scale, writes Garrity. ""For a lamp to work well in your home, it has to be the right scale,"" she writes. ""Don't make the common mistake of picking a lamp that is so little or delicate it will be overpowered by the size of the room and its furnishings. Instead, look for a lamp that's a bit beefier, carrying enough visual weight to hold its own on a sofa table, end table or buffet.""","Mary Carol Garrity, TNS"
348,detroitnews,,,10,"Console character: Garrity says console tables are a great way to visually divide a larger living room into more intimate conversation areas. ""Wood pieces add much-needed weight and structure to a room,"" writes Garrity. ""And consoles are perfect if you want a table that delivers maximum visual impact using a minimal amount of space.""","Mary Carol Garrity, TNS"

419,detroitnews,,,10,"1. Casey Mize, RH starter, 21, 6-3, 220: Those who argue Matt Manning should sit in that top slot have a case. You could go with either Mize or Manning here. But only because his four pitches are more refined is Mize winning the bluest of blue ribbons. He was last June’s litter-pick as the best amateur talent in America. He’ll get a chance to show at Lakeland and Erie, and maybe higher in 2019, why he’s a potential jewel in a remade Tigers rotation.","Cliff Welch, Associated Press"
419,detroitnews,,,10,"2. Matt Manning, RH starter, 21, 6-6, 190: Credit the Tigers scouts on this call. It’s gutsy to take a prep pitcher, having no more experience than Manning had in 2016, with a ninth overall pick. But what a payoff it should bring. Manning gets better, stronger, and more overpowering each week during his farm seminars. He has one of the best curveballs anywhere in minor-league ball and is throwing harder as strength and mechanics and pure athleticism coalesce. Could be a staff ace.","Robin Buckson, Detroit News"
419,detroitnews,,,10,"3. Isaac Paredes, IF, 19, 5-11, 225: Yes, 19 years old -- for a few more days, anyway. This is what he did in 39 games last year at Double A: .321 batting average, .406 on-base, .864 slugging. He has a right-handed swing that as early as next season could be a trigger to the Tigers’ reconstituted lineup. He probably is headed for third base unless he drops 30-40 pounds, which would be one mean feat. The bat will find its way into the lineup’s mid-order, wherever Paredes plays.","Robin Buckson, Detroit News"
419,detroitnews,,,10,"4. Franklin Perez, RH starter, 21, 6-3, 197: A year ago, Perez was atop our best-50 Tigers farm report. This year he slips three spots, mostly because he pitched in only seven games last season due to LAT muscle and shoulder issues that have since healed. He should return with Perez-like prowess in 2019. This was the premier prize in the Tigers’ three-player trade return for Justin Verlander. A healthy spring camp and no black cats accompanying him to the mound during the regular season should restore his prospect prestige.","Robin Buckson, Detroit News"

However, that doesn’t change the wins over Maryland and Iowa earlier in the week as MSU now gets a few days off before hosting Indiana on Saturday. Last week: 1","Michael Conroy, AP"
494,detroitnews,,,10,"2. Michigan (19-1, 8-1) – By the end of the week, the Wolverines had bounced back just fine from their first loss of the season, though it didn’t come easily early in the week at home vs. Minnesota. A last-second shot kept the Wolverines from a possible upset before they hit the road and demoralized Indiana. A big week is on tap with a visit from Ohio State followed by a trip to Iowa. Last week: 2.","Andy Lyons, Getty Images"
494,detroitnews,,,10,"3. Purdue (14-6, 7-2) – The Boilermakers have now won eight of nine and on Sunday avenged the only loss by getting up big on Michigan State before holding off a furious rally. The Boilermakers are busy proving all the analytics right by creeping near the top of the standings, where they’ll likely stay this week with games against Penn State and Minnesota. Last week: 4.","Michael Conroy, AP"
494,detroitnews,,,10,"4. Wisconsin (14-6, 6-3) – The victory over Michigan last week might have kickstarted the Badgers, who have now won three straight after cruising past Illinois and Northwestern as big man Ethan Happ recorded a triple-double in the win over Northwestern. They’ll head to Nebraska this week and cap things off at home vs. Maryland to try and keep pace with the conference leaders. Last week: 6.","Andy Manis, AP"
494,detroitnews,,,10,"5. Maryland (16-5, 7-3) – Everything was going well for the young Terrapins entering the week as they had won seven straight. But life in the Big Ten caught up with the Terps as they went on the road and got handled by first-place Michigan State before losing to Illinois in New York. It was the sort of inconsistency that exists with young teams, something the Terps will need to turn around this week against Northwestern and at Wisconsin. Last week: 3.","Adam Hunger, AP"
494,detroitnews,,,10,"6. Minnesota (15-5, 5-4) – The Golden Gophers were just seconds away from possibly having a three-game winning streak. It turns out, the only loss in the last three games was at the buzzer at Michigan, something the Gophers bounced back from by outscoring Iowa on Sunday night. The Gophers will have a chance to keep rolling early in the week vs. Illinois before a stiff test on Sunday at Purdue. Last week: 8.","Andy Clayton-King, AP"
494,detroitnews,,,10,"7. Iowa (16-5, 5-5) – A tough week for the Hawkeyes saw a five-game winning streak come to an end. First, they gave up a lead at home to Michigan State, then went on the road and lost a high-scoring game at Minnesota. Only one game is up this week as the Hawkeyes seek consistency, and that will be tough as first-place Michigan comes to Carver-Hawkeye Arena on Friday. Last week: 5.","Andy Clayton-King, AP"
494,detroitnews,,,10,"8. Ohio State (13-6, 3-5) – The Buckeyes were spiraling out of control after Purdue handed them their fifth straight loss. But they responded with a big road win at Nebraska to start to right the ship. They’ll get a chance to see how much things have turned around when they head to Michigan this week with a chance to climb back into the top half of the standings, followed by a home game with Rutgers.
