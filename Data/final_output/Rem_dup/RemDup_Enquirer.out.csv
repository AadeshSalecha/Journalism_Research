127,enquirer,,,10,"1. Jungle Jim's Big Cheese Festival:
Cheese. Is there anything it can't do? Well, okay, so it can't change a flat tire, but nibbling on some can make you feel a whole lot happier as you wait for roadside assistance. Yes, cheese can turn pretty much any situation into a party and complements nearly every foodstuff imaginable. It's perfect all by itself, too.
If cheese is your BFF, the place to be this weekend is the Oscar Event Center at Jungle Jim's International Market (5440 Dixie Highway, Fairfield), where you'll have the opportunity to sample (aka gorge yourself with) unique international cheeses and charcuterie, and for an additional fee, enjoy cheese with specially-paired beers and wines.
Now for a cheesy joke: What do you call cheese that is sad? Bleu cheese. Saturday is already completely sold out but, you've still got a chance to pay homage to the fromage from noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. General admission tickets are $20 in advance and $25 at the door (if still available). Consider yourself something of a big cheese? Splash out on the VIP experience ($75 advance, $80 door, if available) which gets ya additional cheese and drink options, plus a signature tasting glass to sample all-inclusive whiskeys, beers and wines in a special, reserved area. junglefests.com.",ThinkStock
127,enquirer,,,10,"2. Winter Xscape Indoor Beach Party:
It's winter in Cincinnati, where we're dealing with a sub-zero degree polar vortex one day and it's sunny and 60 the next. This bi-polar vortex wrecks havoc on a person's wardrobe. Snow boots or sandals? Ski suits or swimsuits? This weekend, opt for warm weather gear and enjoy an indoor vacation on the shores of Newport's Festival Park (between the Taylor Southgate and Purple People bridges) as the Winter Xscape Indoor Beach Party brings a taste of the tropics to the Queen City.
This free-admission ""event in a giant tent"" boasts an indoor, real-sand beach, a jumbo ""island vision"" beach board, sand volleyball, coconut bowling, limbo contests, hula dancing with some of the area's favorite bands, a silent disco, tropical food – including a pig roast – and special beach-style drinks complete with tiny umbrellas. Aw, yeah! Grab your flip-flops and hit up the fun anytime from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and 1 p.m. to 1 a.m. Saturday. cincinnatifestivalsandevents.com/winter-xscape.",Charlie Kaijo/The Republic
127,enquirer,,,10,"3. Jackie O's Record Fair:
Once upon a time, record stores ruled the landscape. Then came the digital age, when denizens eschewed vinyl records in favor of shiny compact discs. My mom used to say that if you live long enough, everything old is new again. And so it is with vinyl, which never completely disappeared but is thankfully no longer relegated to a small dark corner of the music-buying world. Record fairs are nothing new to those who've kept the vinyl love alive, and chances are good there may already be a few collectors queuing outside Bogart's right now, waiting for the doors to open on Sunday for the first-ever Jackie O's Record Fair (2621 Vine St., Corryville). More than 30 vendors will be on hand selling new releases, reissues, used and highly sought-after mint originals from every era and genre. The show runs from noon to 5 p.m. and costs $5 unless you are one of those already salivating over the idea of mint originals. If so, fork over $10 and get in an hour early to score the goods. bogarts.com.",Darryl Webb/Special for The Republic
127,enquirer,,,10,"4. My Furry Valentine:
Did you know that each year over 7 million dogs and cats enter shelters nationwide, and nearly 3 million end up being euthanized? That's a saddening statistic, but when you choose to adopt a pet instead of buying one from a pet store, breeder or online, you are helping to reduce the number of animals killed in shelters. Now imagine this: Dozens of different rescue and shelter groups from around Greater Cincinnati bringing hundreds of adoptable pets to one convenient location. That's My Furry Valentine in a nutshell. All animals participating are fully vaccinated, spayed/neutered and have health records on site. Every adopted pet also goes home with a swag bag of goodies to help make the transition from shelter to forever home.
My Furry Valentine happens from noon-6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Sharonville Convention Center (11355 Chester Road). Early birds can get in at 10 a.m. for $25, otherwise, general admission is $5 (free for ages 5-under). myfurryvalentine.com.",Jim Weber/The Commercial Appeal
127,enquirer,,,10,"5. Dearborn County Home & Garden Show:
Already dreaming of what you'd like to plant this year? Or maybe you're considering a remodel? Let the professionals over at the Home and Garden Show give you a head start on planning your home improvement, interior design, landscaping, lawn care, remodeling, organizing and deck and patio solutions.
The event happens this weekend over at Lawrenceburg Event Center (91 Walnut St.). Admission is $6 per person, with a half-off discount to those who bring a canned or boxed food item for the Dearborn Clearinghouse when purchasing their ticket. The show runs 5-9 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturday and noon-5 p.m. Sunday. dearborncountyhba.org.",Robert Killips | Lansing State Journal
