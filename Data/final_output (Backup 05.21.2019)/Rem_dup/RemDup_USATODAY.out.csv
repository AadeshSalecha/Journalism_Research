Afghanistan. Advisory level: Level 4: Do not travel. Last updated: July 9, 2018. Population: 34.7 million. GDP per capita: $580. With the Taliban and ISIS still forces to be reckoned with, the State Department has advised that travel to all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe because of high levels of kidnappings, hostage taking, suicide bombings, military combat operations, landmines and terrorist and insurgent attacks. Terrorists have targeted Afghan and U.S. government convoys and facilities as well as nongovernmental organization offices, hospitals, places of worship, restaurants, hotels, airports and schools. The U.S. government’s ability to provide services to Americans in Afghanistan is constrained because of the lack of infrastructure, geographic limitations, and a volatile security situation.",sasacvetkovic33 / Getty Images
764,usatoday,,,10,"2. Burkina Faso. Advisory level: Level 3: Reconsider travel. Last updated: Oct. 11, 2018. Population: 18.6 million. GDP per capita: $610. While the general advisory to Burkina Faso is Level 3 – reconsider travel, the State Department advises against traveling to one region in the country — the northern Sahel border with Mali and Niger. In that region, organized criminal groups and terrorists particularly target Westerners, plotting kidnappings. In the entire country — a landlocked nation in western Africa — terrorist targets could include hotels, restaurants, police stations and schools.",DmitryTrashchenko / Getty Images
764,usatoday,,,10,"3. Burundi. Advisory level: Level 3: Reconsider travel. Last updated: Aug. 29, 2018. Population: 10.5 million. GDP per capita: $280. Though Westerners are not likely targets of violent crimes in Burundi, grenade attacks and armed robbery are common. Burundi police resources are inadequate to address criminal acts, according to the U.S. government. There also is lingering political tension in the African nation, whose GDP per capita of $280 is among the lowest in the world. Frequent police and military checkpoints limit the ability to move freely. The U.S. government says the provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza are susceptible to raids from armed groups from the eastern section of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.S. government said it has scarce resources to provide to Americans in Burundi. The State Department added that medical services in Burundi are not up to American standards.",mtcurado / Getty Images
764,usatoday,,,10,"4. Central African Republic. Advisory level: Level 4: Do not travel. Last updated: Oct. 3, 2018. Population: 4.6 million. GDP per capita: $380. Another high-risk country is the Central African Republic, which has been unstable since it gained independence from France in 1960. The State Department advises Americans not to travel to the CAR because of crime and civil instability. The U.S. government has raised concerns over incidences of armed robbery, aggravated battery, and homicide. Many swaths of the Central African Republic are controlled by armed groups who kidnap, injure and kill civilians, according to the U.S. government. Because of unrest in the Central African Republic, airports, land borders and roads may close with little advance notice. U.S. government personnel must get permission to travel outside the embassy grounds and therefore may be limited in how much help they can provide U.S. citizens.",USO / Getty Images

Chad has been victimized by violent crimes, such as armed robbery, carjacking and muggings. Terrorists have targeted foreigners, local security forces and civilians. The U.S. government says terrorists can cross Chad’s borders with little difficulty, including in the Lake Chad region. Of particular concern are unmapped minefields along the borders with Libya and Sudan. U.S. government employees need to get special permission to travel to certain parts of the capital N’Djamena, as well as areas such as to the Lake Chad Basin.",konane / Getty Images

Democratic Republic of the Congo. Advisory level: Level 3: Reconsider travel. Last updated: Dec. 14, 2018. Population: 78.7 million. GDP per capita: $460. The U.S. government says some areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have an increased level of risk. Americans are urged not to travel to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the three Kasai provinces because of violence. Armed robbery, home invasion and assault are among the crimes that often occur in the DRC. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, assailants have been known to impersonate police or security agents. Police in the DRC lack the resources to combat violent crime. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also grappling with a worsening Ebola outbreak. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to Americans outside of the capital Kinshasa because of inadequate infrastructure and security.",guenterguni / Getty Images

El Salvador. Advisory level: Level 3: Reconsider travel. Last updated: Jan. 29, 2019. Population: 6.3 million. GDP per capita: $3,930. Crime, not terrorism, is the biggest concern in El Salvador. Violent crime — murder, assault, rape and armed robbery — occurs frequently in the Central American country. The capital city of San Salvador has been in the top 20 most dangerous cities in the world since 2014, reaching No. 3 two years ago. Extortion and narcotics and arms trafficking are widespread and the police do not have the resources to fight crime. The U.S. government advises those who travel to El Salvador to avoid walking or driving at night, not to resist a robbery attempt, and to be observant when visiting banks or ATMs.",hartmanc10 / Getty Images
764,usatoday,,,10,"8. Guinea-Bissau. Advisory level: Level 3: Reconsider travel. Last updated: Aug. 2, 2018. Population: 1.8 million. GDP per capita: $640. The U.S. government wants American citizens to reconsider travelling to Guinea-Bissau because of crime and civil unrest. In Guinea-Bissau, criminals target foreigners at the country’s airport and at the market in the center of the capital of Bissau. The State Department says local police resources are inadequate to respond effectively to criminal incidents. Guinea-Bissau, once a Portuguese colony and a transshipment point for the slave trade, has been plagued by political instability for decades. There is no U.S. embassy in the nation, which is located on Africa’s Atlantic coast.",Virginia Yunes / Getty Images
764,usatoday,,,10,"9. Haiti. Advisory level: Level 3: Reconsider travel. Last updated: Jan. 18, 2019. Population: 10.8 million. GDP per capita: $790. Crime and civil unrest are the reasons why the U.S. government is advising Americans to reconsider travel to Haiti. The nation that was devastated by an earthquake in 2010 now reels from violent crime such as armed robbery. Travelers are sometimes targeted and robbed after they arrive at the airport in Port-au-Prince. The U.S. embassy requires its employees to use official transportation to and from the airport. They are discouraged from going to establishments after dark that do not have secure parking, visiting banks and using ATMs, driving outside of Port-au-Prince at night, or using public transportation or taxis.",La_Corivo / Getty Images

Honduras is another Central American country the U.S. government advises Americans to reconsider traveling to because of crime such as extortion, rape and narcotics and human trafficking. Since 2010, Honduras has had one of the highest murder rates in the world. Violent crime remains an issue. Bandits have been known to attack vehicles bringing tourists to hotels from the airport. Americans are advised not to travel to the region of Gracias a Dios, where danger is elevated because of the lack of emergency services.",diegograndi / Getty Images

15. Renaissance Island, Aruba
The pink flamingos on Renaissance Island, which is private, have become a major attraction. However, some tourists say the birds' wings have been clipped so they can't leave (and thus continue to be a draw for tourists). The only way to get to the island is if you buy a day pass, which costs about $125, but a daily trip is not guaranteed. You can get it only if the island is under 80 percent capacity.",davidstanleytravel / Flickr
793,usatoday,,,10,"14. Santorini, Greece
Greece has gone through its share of turmoil over the last decade, but none of its problems have to do with tourism. The country, and especially its islands, are considered some of the most beautiful places to visit, and tourism is booming. The number of visitors rose to a record 32 million in 2018. But more people bring more problems, and Santorini, the most-visited Greek island, is feeling it. You go for the sunsets and seascapes, but end up dealing with traffic jams and huge crowds. You will find fewer people, but as many beautiful sights, on Syros, Sikinos, and Lemnos.",MartinM303 / Getty Images
793,usatoday,,,10,"13. French Quarter in New Orleans
The French Quarter is a 24/7 party hotspot. This means it's noisy (not great if you aim to sleep on your visit there), overcrowded and overpriced. The historic neighborhood may feel like a tourist trap, especially if you go there for nightime entertainment and around Mardi Gras. For a less expensive overnight stay, consider the Central Business District, which is not far from the French Quarter. This is where business travelers stay.",benedek / Getty Images
793,usatoday,,,10,"12. Mount Rushmore, South Dakota
You already know what you're going to see. You've seen the monument up-close on TV, in books and online many times. Scaling the monument is not allowed, and there are no tours that will take you to the top. (Regular tours will take you to the bottom of the memorial and they start at around $100.) You go, stop, stare for a few minutes, and leave. There are no accommodations, and nothing else to do nearby. (The nearest gas station is 14 miles away.) So explore the surrounding Black Hills National Forest; it may be a more gratifying experience.",Kjsmith47 / Getty Images
793,usatoday,,,10,"11. Niagara Falls, U.S. side
Niagara Falls is one of the most famous and beautiful waterfalls in the world. But what will you do in town? Not much. Eat at a lot of fast food joints and buy a lot of souvenirs from gift shops. And spend about $300 per night at a hotel. And knowing that the flow of water is controlled in order to produce hydro power further reduces the appeal of a trip there.",nilapictures / Getty Images

Its 50,000 residents deal with about 30 million visitors a year. During peak times, tourists and locals can be separated, with visitors being redirected to popular places while some areas are only open to locals. Big cruise ships are no longer allowed to steam past the popular St Mark's Square.",Sergey Ashmarin / Wikimedia Commons

This is a gigantic money-making resort, so don't expect an authentic Caribbean experience. Aside from that, many guests have found it disappointing and overpriced, with rude staff and faulty spa charges. Rates start at $200 per night, in addition to the nightly fee, but that price only gives you access to the gym, waterpark and movie theater. Any other activities, such as fishing charters, tours, special classes and golf, are extra. That, in addition to a round-trip ticket costing over $400 per person from New York City, sounds like an overrated trip.",AlpamayoPhoto / Getty Images
793,usatoday,,,10,"8. Hong Kong 
Hong Kong isn't a huge territory (about a third of the size of Rhode Island). It has just over 7.3 million residents, but it sees 10 times as many visitors. More than 65 million tourists visited the region in 2018, a new record. There was an increase in tourists from mainland China, day-trippers and overnight visitors. There is much to see in Hong Kong, but walking there isn't a pleasant experience. While public transport is cheap, the same can't be said of hotels. A 5-star hotel starts at around $230 a night. The city was recently ranked the most expensive in the Cost of Living Survey by Mercer, a human resources consulting firm.",balipadma / Getty Images
793,usatoday,,,10,"7. Las Vegas
Las Vegas is the most overrated city in the world, at least according to a 2015 Yahoo Travel survey. As the consummate adult playground, a trip to Vegas may be appropriate for a 21st birthday or a bachelor/ette party, but not much else. A city in which casinos (read spending money for nothing or with little chance of return) are the primary attraction can easily leave you close to bankrupt. While airline tickets to Vegas aren't too expensive (a round-trip ticket from New York City is about $200), expenses will add up. Aside from gambling and knocking down cocktails, you will likely go to see a lot of shows. Tickets to Van Morrison and Mariah Carey start at $120, and various Cirque du Soleil shows cost around $100.",f11photo / Getty Images
793,usatoday,,,10,"6. Pisa, Italy
Most people who go to Pisa, a city in the beautiful region of Tuscany in Italy that is worth a trip, have one goal in mind – seeing the iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa … and ""attempting"" to fix it. The thing is, the tower is much smaller than it looks in photos. Also, a day trip from nearby cities such as Florence, just to end up taking the same picture as everyone else, is going to cost around $90. Tuscany is known for its idyllic landscapes, art, food, wine and hilltop towns – so go explore those instead.",Mstyslav Chernov / Wikimedia Commons
