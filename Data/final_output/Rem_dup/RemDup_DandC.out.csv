FROM SHAWN: I was out looking for photos for our D&C Instagram account and swung by the Summerville Pier. From the shore end of the pier, I could see a small lump out at the other end, so I put on Yaktrax as the pier was covered over in ice and headed out to see if it really was a snowy owl and if I could get a photo. For me, the key to getting this was patience - I walked as slow as I could so as not to scare the owl off, or stress it. I would take five steps, stop, another five, stop, wait a minute, then five more, so on down the pier. About 30 minutes later I was maybe 50 yards away. I slowly kneeled to lessen my size to the owl, and took maybe 10 photos using a 100-400 lens with a 1.4 teleconverter.  I also cropped this image way in to this tight version.  When the owl made a little shoulder twitch, that was my sign to leave. I slowly crouched up, then backed away down the pier. I don't need to make the owl fly off to make a meaningful photo. I don't want to stress it, or force it off a meal or from this spot it clearly chose to hunt from.  Patience and respect to me are pretty important with photographing wildlife.",SHAWN DOWD/ROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AN

Shooting with a 100-400 zoom lens from the base of the jump, you don't really see the skiers until each one shoots off the end of one of the three ramps at Bristol.
