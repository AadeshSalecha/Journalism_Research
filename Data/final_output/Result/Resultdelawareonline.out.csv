At least 20 people were killed and over 80 others were injured in twin bombings during a Sunday mass at Jolo Cathedral in Mindanao region of the volatile southern Philippines, officials said. The attack comes days after people overwhelmingly voted 'yes' in a referendum on autonomy that was held for peace in the mainly Muslim region. The province of Sulu, whose capital is Jolo, voted against integrating into Bangsamoro, but since it is part of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao with four other provinces its votes are counted in a block and will belong to this new entity. In Sulu, several radical groups linked to the Islamic State, such as Abu Sayyaf or the Maute group, have been responsible for bloody attacks in the past.","Laurenz Castillo, EPA-EFE"
