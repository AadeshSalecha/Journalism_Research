Officials closed their emergency operations center Tuesday after the threat of ice on metro Atlanta’s interstates and state routes no longer posed a danger to travelers “Everything looks good, roads are clear,” said Natalie Dale, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Transportation. “We were really fortunate given the amount of rain we got and the dropping temperatures that we were able to keep the roads free of ice. We had a relatively incident-free morning.” The gusty winds were a double-edged sword, helping to dry up wet patches on roads but knocking down ice-laden trees and power lines, especially in northeast Georgia. Metro Atlanta was largely spared from dire predictions of black ice, with just a few icy spots that were quickly remedied. No major accidents occurred. About 188,000 customers lost power in North Georgia between the state’s largest utility, Georgia Power, and Georgia’s Electric Membership Cooperatives, according to data released at about 9:45 a.m. JOHN SPINK/JSPINK@AJC.COM",Photo: JOHN SPINK / AJC
