But they also knock it out of the park with pretty much every other kind of fare as well. Tex-Mex? You can’t visit without trying a breakfast taco from Papalote. Sushi? Uchi has fresh fish flown in every day from Japan. Opulent afternoon tea? Yup, they have that too at The Driskill hotel. That’s on top of the more than 1,000 food trucks in the city. Swing by any one of those, and you can get everything from falafel and rice at Halal Time to chow-chow doughnuts at Little Lucy’s Mini Donuts. The problem? You could move there and still not have enough time try all the options. (Alfie Photography/Shutterstock.com)",Alfie Photography/Shutterstock.com
