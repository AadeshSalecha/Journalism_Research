Gov-elect, Justin Fairfax, right, and Attorney General Mark Herring at the Capitol in Richmond, Va.  The political crisis in Virginia exploded Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2019,  when the state’s attorney general confessed to putting on blackface in the 1980s and a woman went public with detailed allegations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor. With Northam’s career already hanging by a thread over a racist photo, the day’s developments threatened to take down all three of Virginia’s top elected officials.
