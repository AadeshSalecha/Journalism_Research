Howard Unruh lived a relatively quiet life in the Cramer Hill section of Camden before paranoia began to kick in and Unruh suddenly convinced himself that everyone in Cramer Hill despised him and had nothing but bad things to say about him. In September 1949, he loaded his gun and consulted the lists of shopkeepers, neighbors and local townspeople that had scorned him and drifted off to sleep. ----PHOTO: In this Sept. 6, 1949 picture, Howard Unruh, center, is shown with police after his capture in Camden, N.J.

541,asburyparkpress,,,10,"The next day, Unruh ate breakfast with his mother, changed his clothes, grabbed his loaded gun and left the house. His first victim was 27-year-old cobbler John Pilarchik at a nearby shoemaker’s store. Next, Unruh traveled next door to a barbershop and shot 6-year-old Orris Smith who was getting his haircut for the first day of school by barber Clark Hoover, who Unruh shot seconds later. Unruh continued to fire into windows as he walked down the street toward a local drug store where he killed four more people. He killed five people waiting at a red light outside of the store, then two more at a local tailor shop. By the time he stopped at his house to retrieve more ammo, Unruh had killed 13 people and wounded four in a span of 20 minutes.
---- PHOTO: Maurice and Rose Cohen, two of the 13 victims of Unruh’s deadly rampage through East Camden on Sept. 6, 1949, are pictured. Maurice was a druggist and owner of the former River Road Pharmacy at 3200 River Road. His mother, Minnie Cohen, was also killed.",FILE PHOTO
541,asburyparkpress,,,10,"Over 50 police officers surrounded his residence and began bombarding the building with machine guns and pistols. Unruh didn’t budge though, prompting the officers to throw a tear gas cannister through the window. Unruh surrendered minutes later and exited his home through a backdoor. He admitted to the mass murder deemed the “Walk of Death” by local Camden residents and was admitted to the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital. Psychiatrists diagnosed Unruh with paranoid schizophrenia and he was declared unfit to stand trial and was never charged for his horrific crimes. He remained at the hospital for 60 years until his death in October 2009.
