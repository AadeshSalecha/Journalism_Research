             Could a similar selection of just 80 plays, about half as many as what is typically listed on some of today’s play sheets, work in the modern game?
            </p>
            <p>
             “It’s not about plays, it’s about execution,” Parcells said. “Sometimes people do better with more. I was always someone who tried to do better with less.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who calls the plays for New England, operates a version of the same offense, designed by Ron Erhardt and Ray Perkins, that Parcells deployed with the Giants and later with the Jets when Bill Belichick was his defensive coordinator. It’s one designed to reduce the number of plays. So it isn’t a surprise that McDaniels is also a “less is more” guy.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You’ve got to be careful with going overboard and doing too many things that are unfamiliar to your players,” McDaniels said in a conference call earlier this season. “The most important thing is that [the players] know what to do and can do it at a high level.”
