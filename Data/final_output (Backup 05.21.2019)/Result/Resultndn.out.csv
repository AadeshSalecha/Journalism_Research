41,ndn,,,10,"A Florida panther strolls past a camera trap set up at the Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem Watershed  at 4:15 p.m.  on January 15, 2019. According to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission panthers are generally crepuscular mammals that travel and hunt at dawn or dusk. The camera trap is set up by News-Press photographer Andrew West.  This is from FWC panther biologist Dave Onorato: That is  a young panther, likely just about a year old and perhaps still traveling with Mom.  That panthers is in fine shape, good coat, etc.  This animal surviving to year 1 is already beating the odds (33% survival rate for kittens to year 1).  But, there is still the process of surviving to year 2 that will involve facing a lot of hurdles (dispersal, finding a home range, encountering competitors). ",Andrew West/The News-Press

Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, they could be a mating pair, but he couldn't say for sure because the photos don't show their gender. The FWC website says that mating pairs stay together for about a week. Births can occur at any time of year but are most common between March and July. The gestation period for kittens is 92-96 days. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission  panther biologists estimate there are 120-230 adult panthers and yearlings in Florida.",Andrew West/The News-Press

Time-lapse MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images of normal brain development from the ages 5 and 20 shows the growth and gradual loss of gray matter, which contains cells that process information. (Red areas contain more gray matter, blue areas less.) At the start of puberty, a thinning of gray matter begins, which corresponds to increased cognitive abilities. As the brain pares back redundant connections, it increases the amount of white matter that helps cells communicate and improves the ability to regulate decision-making and emotional arousal.(Photo: Contributed image from Gogtay et al.
