Time-lapse MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images of normal brain development from the ages 5 and 20 shows the growth and gradual loss of gray matter, which contains cells that process information. (Red areas contain more gray matter, blue areas less.) At the start of puberty, a thinning of gray matter begins, which corresponds to increased cognitive abilities. As the brain pares back redundant connections, it increases the amount of white matter that helps cells communicate and improves the ability to regulate decision-making and emotional arousal.(Photo: Contributed image from Gogtay et al.
