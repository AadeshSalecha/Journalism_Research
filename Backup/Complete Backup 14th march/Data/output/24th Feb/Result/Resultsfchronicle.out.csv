481,sfchronicle,,,10,"Three Mile Brewery, Davis 
Unveiled in late February with an alley entrance in downtown Davis, the popular spot is already gearing up for the Davis Bike and Brew Fest and Davis Beer Week, both happening in August. 

In a nod to local history, the name was inspired by the ban on alcohol within a 3-mile radius of the UC Davis campus from 1911 to 1979.

Owned by a group of seven beer enthusiasts, the brewery and taproom was nurtured by a Kickstarter campaign last fall, and currently makes about seven kegs of beer per batch. 

Introductory suds have included a Session IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Barkada Brown ale, Lil’ B Brown, Honey Blonde ale, Saison and a nitrogenated Dry Stout.

Bring your dog if you like; the destination is rustic, with wood and block walls, metal chairs, a concrete floor and a large lighted metal sign reminding us to “drink.” Which we happily do, savoring the sampler presented on a brand-stamped board.

481,sfchronicle,,,10,"Yolo Brewing Company, West Sacramento 
There was good buzz in June 2014 when Yolo Brewing Co. opened its doors in West Sacramento’s Port District. Beer lovers and would-be brewmasters rejoiced, because owner Mike Costello was proprietor of the former Brew It Up restaurant in Davis, which offered a personal brewery option. He’s revived that idea here, with guests invited to make their own beers alongside his own small-batch suds. 

The setting is basic warehouse, but there are lots of distractions beyond sampling the nearly two dozen signature brews, including Hallertauer Lager, Orange Blossom Blonde Ale, DeWit Wild Rice Ale and seasonal Petite Saison. You can fill up at food trucks like Cowtown Urban Eatery, nibble free popcorn, play Jenga, and the best: try your hand at brewing.

Just make a reservation (72 hours in advance for wheat or Belgian beer, to give the crew time to propagate the specialty yeast), then work through a half-day guided crafting session for everything from smooth Dunkel Bock to big, bold Captain Ron’s Double IPA. 

You can also customize recipes, tweaking yeasts or adding extra malt, honey or hops.

Each batch yields about 12.4 gallons, packed in 22-ounce bottles, and costs from $170 to $290, plus $13 per case of refillable bottles. That’s a lot of beer, so Costello recommends sharing the deal with enough friends able to consume the fresh stuff within three months.

481,sfchronicle,,,10,"Bike Dog Brewing Company, West Sacramento
This nano-brewery, which opened in October 2013, produces only about 1,000 barrels a year in tiny batches, sending out a rotating collection of taps that might include Three Dog Night Triple IPA, Tantamount Saison, Mosaic Pale Ale, Saison, San Dog IPA, Lowbrau Milk Stout and the powerhouse, a bourbon-barrel-aged Babaris Russian Imperial Stout that comes in at a lusty 11 percent alcohol. 

Owned by entrepreneurs AJ Tendick, Raef Porter, Sage Smith and Pete Atwood, the boisterous place is indeed bike- and dog-friendly, and if your dog can ride a bike, you’ll probably get a free beer. Kick back at a picnic table or at the bar with antique bikes on display and explore, since generous samples are only $2 each. 

Plan to eat, as well, with weekend food trucks such as Culinerdy Cruzer, known for its burger stacked on top of Brussels sprouts slathered in fig-infused balsamic, and fries smothered in basil, pesto, artichoke hearts, fire-roasted tomatoes and spicy sauce.

Come back often, too, to see what’s new. 

Experimentation is the name of the game. “We have done a wet hop beer with local hops, which was great, but sort of a pain to make and really limited, since hops are only fresh once a year,” said Tendick. “We’ve done a coffee version of our Milk Stout with several local roasters, and some local, backyard-harvested grapefruit zest has gone into our San Dog IPA.”

481,sfchronicle,,,10,"Jackrabbit Brewing Company, West Sacramento
One of the forerunners of the Yolo craft beer movement with its opening in 2011, this brewery focuses on Belgian, English and German-inspired brews via a five-barrel brewing system. But the West Sacramento taproom is shiny new, with an April 2015 grand opening and expansion of production space from 1,500 to 5,000 square feet, including a dog-friendly patio and bar. 

Fancier than other stops with lots of polished wood, gold-tone murals and moody industrial lighting, the vibe is upbeat (witness the playfully themed Ugly Bunny IPA Imperial and Fair Hare golden ale brews) with plenty of humor built around “hoppy” beers. 

New this year are Old Soul Coffee stouts, adding beans from Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia, plus Costa Rica coffee-vanilla and Panama Elida coffee-vanilla in the kegs. Just the thing to go with gyros and falafel from the King Kabob truck that comes by on various weekends.
