From left, Jared Goff with sister, Lauren Goff and parents, Nancy Goff and Jerry Goff.  The Montreal Expos would be thrilled with this Super Bowl,  and those who used to be part of the extinct baseball franchiseâ€™s evaluation process certainly are, even all these years later. Gone from the game for nearly 15 years, the former club has ties to both quarterbacks in Sundayâ€™s NFL championship game. The Expos traded for Jared Goffâ€™s father, Jerry, nearly three decades ago. Goff made his major league debut for Montreal in 1990 and played 55 games for the team as a backup catcher that year and in 1992.
