The biggest chain, in terms of sales, is McDonald’s, where people spent more than $36 billion in 2016, followed by Starbucks with nearly $15 billion, and Subway with $11 billion. Almost 40 percent of people in the United States eat at a fast food restaurant at least once a day. Many of the least-healthy items on fast-food menus contain nearly the entire daily recommended intake of calories, sodium and sugar. The estimated daily calorie need for moderately active adult men is 2,800 and 2,200 for women. The recommended daily limit for salt is 2,300 mg (ideally 1,500 mg), and that of sugar is 25 grams (six teaspoons) for women and 38 grams (nine teaspoons) for men, according to the American Heart Association.",LauriPatterson / Getty Images

The chocolate chip cookie may please your taste buds, but the rest of your body will pay a price. More than a third of the delicious dessert is sugar, and a quarter is fat. There is also 1 gram of trans fats. ""You absolutely want to avoid trans fats because they can increase your 'bad' LDL cholesterol, lower your 'good' HDL cholesterol and increase your chance of heart disease,"" says Amy Gorin, MS, RDN, owner of Amy Gorin Nutrition in the New York City area.",Courtesy of Starbucks

About half of the calories in this breakfast platter come from fat. There are 25 grams of saturated fat, which is 126 percent of the recommended daily value based on a 2,000-calorie diet. The platter also contains 510 mg of cholesterol, which is 169% of the recommended daily value. The Grand Big Mac is not much better. ""The sandwich has 860 calories, 52 grams of fat, 18 grams of saturated fat, and 2 grams of trans fats,"" according to Gorin.

This burger weighs three pounds before it is cooked. It contains eggs, soy, wheat, and milk. More than half of the calories, 648, come from fat, and it contains 4 grams of trans fats.

This burrito contains so much sodium -- 89percentof the recommended daily value -- that you probably shouldn't eat much else with salt in it all day. About 370 of the calories comes from fat. The Fiesta Taco Salad Beef is not a healthy choice either, even though it has ""salad"" in its name. ""This salad is one of the few [Taco Bell] items that contains trans fats,"" Gorin said. The salad has 760 calories, 10 grams of saturated fat, and 1 grams of trans fats. It also contains 1,330 mg of sodium, which is a lot.
